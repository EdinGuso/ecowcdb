# Introduction
**Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)** analysis focuses on giving deterministic delay or backlog guarantees.


This project builds on top of the [panco](https://github.com/Huawei-Paris-Research-Center/panco) project.

        abstract = {Computing accurate deterministic performance bounds is a strong need for communication technologies having stringent requirements on latency and reliability. Within new scheduling protocols such as TSN, the FIFO policy remains at work inside each class of communication. In this paper, we focus on computing deterministic performance bounds in FIFO networks in the Network Calculus framework. We propose a new algorithm based on linear programming that presents a trade-off between accuracy and tractability. This algorithm is first presented for tree networks. Next, we generalize our approach and present a linear program for computing performance bounds for arbitrary topologies, including cyclic dependencies. Finally, we provide numerical results, both of toy examples and realistic topologies, to assess the interest of our approach.}
